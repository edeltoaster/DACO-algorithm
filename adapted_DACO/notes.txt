Changes made compared to adapted_DACO 1.01:
    - added cached implementation cDACO.py that does not recompute already seen computational states but may need significantly more memory
    
Changes made compared to DACO 1.01 prototype:
    - completely removed the data retrieval part
    - added code for DDIN/PPIN format input as given by PPIXpress
    - pairGrwoth behavior now as in JDACO: only above threshold and not at least 2
    - adjusted pruning in pair building towards behaviour of JDACO
    - added prob_threshold parameter (was fixed at 0.5)
    - remove results including only non-seed proteins
    - and changes noted above
    
-> identical behavior and results as JDACO
