Changes made to DACO 1.01 prototype:
    - completely removed the data retrieval part
    - added code for DDIN/PPIN format input as given by PPIXpress
    - pairGrwoth behavior now as in JDACO: only above threshold and not at least 2
    - adjusted pruning in pair building towards behaviour of JDACO (< to >)
    - added prob_threshold (was fixed at 0.5)
    - remove results including only non-seed proteins

    -> identical behavior as JDACO
